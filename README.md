# Backend Projects by roadmap.sh

This repository contains a list of project solutions for the [Backend Developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) roadmap. The projects are divided into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Projects in this repo are maily built with [Go](https://go.dev/)

Solution for each project is in the respective folder. The folder name is the same as the project name. Each project folder contains a readme.md file that describes the project and the solution.
